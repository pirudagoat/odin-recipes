            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Chicken - I like to make Shawarma with boneless, skinless thighs as its juicier than breast.
                     But chicken breast and tenderloin both work great.</li>
                <li>Lemon juice - Fresh!</li>
                <li>Olive oil - For a touch of flavour but also to dilute the lemon juice so it doesn't “cook” the chicken (like we intentionally do with ceviche!).</li>
                <li>Spices - Nothing out of the ordinary here! The only one you might not have in stock is cardamom, though these days its easily found at any grocery store.
                     It has a piney, sort of citrusy flavour and it is a key ingredient that
                      distinguishes the Shawarma marinade from other cuisines, such as Mexican, that regularly
                       uses the other spices used in this recipe. In short, don't skip it!</li>
                <li>Spice control - The spiciness in the Shawarma marinade comes from the cayenne pepper.
                     It's not a key element of the flavour so if you don't want it spicy,
                      either reduce or eliminate it altogether. I promise you won't feel robbed.
                       Lots of other flavours going on in this dish!</li>

            <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix marinade - For convenience, just mix the marinade directly in a ziplock bag.
                     A bag works best because the chicken remains nicely coated in the marinade.
                      If you prefer to use a container, either turn the chicken a few times or increase the marinade by 50%.</li>
                <li>Add chicken into the marinade. Seal the bag, removing excess air,
                     then massage to coat from the outside. Leave to marinade for 12 to 24 hours in the fridge.
                      If you're pressed for time, even 3 hours will do!</li>
                <li>Yogurt sauce - Make the yogurt sauce simply by mixing the ingredients then set aside for at least 20 minutes
                     to let the flavours meld. This will keep for 3 days in the fridge.</li>
                <li>Cook chicken either on the stove or on the BBQ.
                     It will get a great crust on it from the spices, and you will adore the smell.
                      It's intoxicating!</li>
                <li>Rest chicken for at least 3 minutes before serving to allow the juices
                     to redistribute throughout the flesh, else they will just run out everywhere when you slice the meat.</li>
                <li>To serve, just pile everything on a platter and let everybody make their own wraps!
                     The chicken, lettuce, tomato slices, onion, yogurt sauce and warmed flatbreads - homemade
                      or store bought. If the chicken is on the larger side, I sometimes slice it. But if they are smaller, I tend to just leave them whole.</li>
